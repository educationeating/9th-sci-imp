	crossing unit area kept normal to the direction
	of field lines is called magnetic flux density. 
	Its unit is Wb/m2

<h4 class="h4">4. State Right Hand Thumb rule ?</h4>
Ans:	If the current carrying conductor is held in the right hand such that the thumb points in the direction of the current, then the direction of the curl of the finger will give the direction of the magnetic field.

<h4 class="h4">5. Define Magnetic flux and its Units ?	</h4>
Ans: 	Magnetic flux is the number of magnetic
	field lines passing through a given area.
	It is denoted by φ and its unit is weber (Wb).

<h4 class="h4">6. Flemmings Right Hand Rule?</h4>
Ans:	Stretch the thumb, fore finger and
	middle finger of your right hand mutually
	perpendicular to each other. If the fore finger
	indicates the direction of magnetic field and
	the thumb indicates the direction of motion
	of the conductor, then the middle finger will
	indicate the direction of induced current.
	Fleming’s Right hand rule is also called
	'generator rule'.

<h4 class="h4">7. Flemmings Left Hand Rule ?</h4>
Ans: 	The law states that while stretching the
	three fingers of left hand in perpendicular
	manner with each other, if the direction of
	the current is denoted by the middle finger
	of the left hand and the second finger is for
	direction of the magnetic field, then the
	thumb of the left hand denotes the direction
	of the force or movement of the conductor.

<h4 class="h4">8. Electric Motor?</h4>
Ans:	An electric motor is
	a device which converts
	electrical energy into
	mechanical energy.

<h4 class="h4">9. A conductor of length 50 cm carrying a current of 5 A is placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of induction 2×10–3 T. Find the force on the conductor.</h4>
Solution:	Force on the conductor = ILB
		= 5 × 50 × 10–2 × 2 ×10–3
		= 5 × 10–3 N

<h4 class="h4">10. A current carrying conductor of certain length, kept perpendicular to the magnetic field experiences a force F. What will be the force if the current is increased four times, length is halved and magnetic field is tripled?</h4>

<h4 class="h2">ⅠⅠ) 4-Marks </h4>
	<h4 class="h4"> 1. Explain Properties of magnetic lines of force</h4>
Ans:	• Magnetic lines of force are closed,
	continuous curves, extending through the
	body of the magnet.
	• Magnetic lines of force start from the North
	Pole and end at the South Pole.
	• Magnetic lines of force never intersect.
	• They will be maximum at the poles than at
	the equator.
	• The tangent drawn at any point on the
	curved line gives the direction of magnetic
	field.

<h4 class="h4">2. Explain about magnetic levitation train ?</h4>
Ans:	Magnetic levitation (Maglev) is a method
	by which an object is suspended with no
	support other than magnetic fields. In maglev
	trains two sets of magnets are used, one set
	to repel and push the train up off the track,
	then another set to move the floating train
	ahead at great speed without friction. In this

	technology, there is no moving part. The train
	travels along a guideway of magnets which
	controls the train’s stability and speed using
	the basic principles of magnets.

		<h4 class="h2">ⅡⅠ Detail</h4>

		<h4 class="h4">1. Electric generator?</h4>
		Ans:	An alternating current
			(AC) generator, as shown
			in Figure 5.18, consists of
			a rotating rectangular coil
			ABCD called armature
			placed between the two
			poles of a permanent magnet. The two ends of
			this coil are connected to two slip rings S1
			and S2
			.
			The inner sides of these rings are insulated. Two
			conducting stationary brushes B1
			and B2
			are kept
		
			separately on the rings S1
			and S2
			respectively. The
			
			two rings S1
			and S2
			are internally attached to an
			axle. The axle may be mechanically rotated from
			outside to rotate the coil inside the magnetic field.
			Outer ends of the two brushes are connected to
			the external circuit.
		
			When the coil is rotated, the magnetic flux
			linked with the coil changes. This change in
			magnetic flux will lead to generation of induced
			current. The direction of the induced current,
			as given by Fleming’s Right Hand Rule, is along
			ABCD in the coil and in the outer circuit it
			flows from B2
			to B1
			. During the second half of
			rotation, the direction of current is along DCBA
			in the coil and in the outer circuit it flows from
			B1 to B2. As the rotation of the coil continues,
			the induced current in the external circuit is
			changing its direction for every half a rotation
			of the coil.
		
		<h4 class="h4">2. Faraday’s experiments ?</h4>
		Ans:	<span><b><i>• Experiment 1</i></b></span> <br>
				In this experiment, two coils were wound
				on a soft iron ring (separated from each other).
				The coil on the left is connected to a battery and
				a switch K. A galvanometer is attached to the coil
				on the right. When the switch is put ‘on’, at that
				instant, there is a deflection in the galvanometer.
				Likewise, when the switch is put ‘off’, again there
				is a deflection – but in the opposite direction.
				This proves the generation of current.<br>
		
				<span><b><i>• Experiment 2</i></b></span> <br>
				In this experiment, current (or voltage)
				is generated by the movement of the magnet
				in and out of the coil. The greater the number
				of turns, the higher is the voltage generated.<br>
			
				<span><b><i>• Experiment 3</i></b></span> <br>
				In this experiment, the magnet is
				stationary, but the coil is moved in and out of
				the magnetic field (indicated by the magnetic
				lines of force). Here also, current is induced.<br>
		
			<span><b><i>these observations made Faraday to
				conclude that whenever there is a change in the
				magnetic flux linked with a closed circuit an emf
				is produced and the amount of emf induced varies
				directly as the rate at which the flux changes. This
				emf is known as induced emf and the phenomenon
				of producing an induced emf due to change in the
				magnetic flux linked with a closed circuit is known
				as electromagnetic induction.</i></b></span>

		Ans:	<span><b><i>a) Test with a litmus paper:</i></b></span> <br>
					An acid turns blue litmus paper into red.
					A base turns red litmus paper into blue.<br>
					<span><b><i>b) Test with an indicator Phenolphthalein:</i></b></span> <br>
					In acid medium, phenolphthalein is
					colourless. In basic medium, phenolphthalein
					is pink in colour. <br>
					<span><b><i>c) Test with an indicator Methyl orange:</i></b></span> <br>
					In acid medium, methyl orange is pink
					in colour. In basic medium, methyl orange is
					yellow in colour. <br>
		<h4 class="h4">4. Uses of Bases?</h4>
		Ans:	(i) Sodium hydroxide is used in the manufacture
			of soap. <br>
			(ii) Calcium hydroxide is used in white washing
			of building. <br>
			(iii) Magnesium hydroxide is used as a medicine
			for stomach disorder. <br>
			(iv) Ammonium hydroxide is used to remove
			grease stains from cloths. <br>
