<h4 class="h4">1. Magnetic Filed and SI Units?</h4>
Ans:	magnetic field is the region around the magnet where its
	magnetic influence can be felt. It is denoted by B
	and its unit is Tesla.

<h4 class="h4">2. Define Magnetic Field Lines ?</h4>
Ans:	A magnetic field line is defined as a curve
	drawn in the magnetic field in such a way that
	the tangent to the curve at any point gives the
	direction of the magnetic field.

<h4 class="h4">3.Define Magnetic flux density and SI Unit ?</h4>
Ans: 	The number of magnetic field lines
	crossing unit area kept normal to the direction
	of field lines is called magnetic flux density. 
	Its unit is Wb/m2

<h4 class="h4">4. State Right Hand Thumb rule ?</h4>
(not posted)

<h4 class="h4">5. Define Magnetic flux and its Units ?	</h4>
Ans: 	Magnetic flux is the number of magnetic
	field lines passing through a given area.
	It is denoted by φ and its unit is weber (Wb).

<h4 class="h4">6. Flemmings Right Hand Rule?</h4>
Ans:	Stretch the thumb, fore finger and
	middle finger of your right hand mutually
	perpendicular to each other. If the fore finger
	indicates the direction of magnetic field and
	the thumb indicates the direction of motion
	of the conductor, then the middle finger will
	indicate the direction of induced current.
	Fleming’s Right hand rule is also called
	'generator rule'.

<h4 class="h4">7. Flemmings Left Hand Rule ?</h4>
Ans: 	The law states that while stretching the
	three fingers of left hand in perpendicular
	manner with each other, if the direction of
	the current is denoted by the middle finger
	of the left hand and the second finger is for
	direction of the magnetic field, then the
	thumb of the left hand denotes the direction
	of the force or movement of the conductor.

<h4 class="h4">8. Electric Motor?</h4>
Ans:	An electric motor is
	a device which converts
	electrical energy into
	mechanical energy.

<h4 class="h4">9. A conductor of length 50 cm carrying a current of 5 A is placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of induction 2×10–3 T. Find the force on the conductor.</h4>
Solution:	Force on the conductor = ILB
		= 5 × 50 × 10–2 × 2 ×10–3
		= 5 × 10–3 N

<h4 class="h4">10. A current carrying conductor of certain length, kept perpendicular to the magnetic field experiences a force F. What will be the force if the current is increased four times, length is halved and magnetic field is tripled?</h4>
Solution:	F = I L B = (4I) × ( L/2) × (3 B) = 6 F
		Therefore, the force increases six times.

<h4 class="h4">11. Laws of reflection ?</h4>
Ans: 	The laws of reflection are:
	<br>• The angle in which the sound is incident is
	equal to the angle in which it is reflected.
	<br>• Direction of incident sound, the reflected
	sound and the normal are in the same plane.

<h4 class="h4">12. Distinguish Between Real and virtual image ?</h4>

<h4 class="h4">13. Sulphuric acid is called King of Chemicals. Why is it called so?</h4>
Ans:	Sulphuric acid is called King of Chemicals
	because it is used in the preparation of 
	many Other compounds. It is used in car
	batteries also. Acids react with metallic
	oxides to give salt and water.CaO + H2S04
	CaS04 + H20

<h4 class="h4">14.Classify acids based on their sources and basicity.</h4>
Ans:	Acids are classified in different ways as follows:
	Based on their sources:
	<br>•Organic acids: Acids present in plants and animals 
	(living things) are organic acids. Example: HCOOH, CH3COOH
	<br>•Inorganic acids: Acids prepared from rocks and minerals
	 are inorganic acids or mineral acids. Example: HCl, HNO3, H2SO4
